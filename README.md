## Usage  

### Adding Foliage  

1. **Add Parent Object**  
   - Put the object you want to add foliage to in the "Parent Object" section.  
   - If you want to add foliage to multiple meshes, create an empty object, drag all your meshes into it, and place the empty object in the "Parent Object" section.

2. **Add Object Prefabs**  
   - Press "Add Object Prefab" and assign the foliage prefabs you want to use.  
   - For grass prefabs, set "Quantity" to **High**.  
   - For tree prefabs, set "Quantity" to **Low**.
